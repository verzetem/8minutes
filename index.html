      <p style="text-align: left; margin: 0px 0px 70px 0px"> I was born in Brawley, CA, a small farm town near the border of Mexicali, and lived in Imperial for about 9 years. Attended school at Ben Hulse Elementary for as long as I can remember before moving. I was deep into BMX at the time (Bicycle motorcross). I had made it to the Intermediate class, and was well on my way making Expert within a few years. Dad found a better paying job in Yuma, Arizona, and so we moved. </p>

      <img src="img/tumbleweed.gif" alt="tumbleweed" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 0px 10px" />
      <p style="text-align: left"> We moved when I was 9. Dad had found a better paying job working at an RV service shop. I attended Mary A. Otondo Elementary for about a year. It was here that I first rode a motorcycle- an old Honda 3 wheeler. One very hot day (near the end of our stay in Yuma), I found my mother stairing out the window towards the street. I walked up and stood beside her, then looked the direction she was looking. There was a light breeze as we neared another monsoon season, and a tumbleweed blew past our house on the street before us. We stood there in silence for about 4-5 minutes, watching that tumbleweed, before my mother turned to me and said "Dang, we gotta get outta here..." LOL. Dad once again found a better job opportunity. This time back in Los Angeles. So we moved again. </p>

    <hr class="style11" />

      <p style="text-align: left"> We moved to Irvine, CA (most likely the prettiest city I've ever lived in). Dad found the job that would end up becoming his specialty: A/V and home automation. The commute was killer... Irvine to Los Angeles, but dad made it work by lane splitting on his motorcycle. I went to Turtle Rock Elementary, where my homeroom teacher called me an "enigma" since I was "a good kid" but wasn't applying myself. I was sick of all the moving by this time, and tired of making new friends only to have to leave them to try and make other friends in a completely different city. Not much happened in this period of my life. I just attended school for about a year, and then we moved AGAIN!</p>

    <h2 style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 325px; color: #6de6ff; text-align: center; font-size: 20px">San Francisco Bay Area (great place to visit.. JUST to visit) </h2>
    <img src="img/sfbridge.jpg" alt="san francisco bridge" style="float: left; padding: 25px 5px 0px 10px; width: 22%; height: auto;" />
    <hr class="style11" />

      <p style="text-align: left"> San Francisco back in 2002/2003 was amazing. There were lots of people, but it wasn't overcrowded (yet). Traffic was bearable (as bad or worse than LA now), there weren't a billion activitsts (no offense), and I feel like life was just a tad bit slower than it is now. The new job dad secured was stable, and lasted well into 2015. This period in my life had many ups and many downs. My first love and heartbreak, my first job, my first car and motorcycle, dirt biking, street racing, airsofting, concerts and festivals, and much more. I attended Taylor Middle School in Millbrae, and then Mills High until graduation. I was not a very good student at either of these schools, and for different reasons. I was still aggitated and a bit depressed that we had to move yet again (in middle school). By high school, I stopped caring as much about the moving around. However, I discovered women, and nearly flunked out of my sophomore, junior, and  senior years because of that. My first girlfriend and I would skip school to get back to her house before anyone else did which directly contributed to my quickly declining grades. I worked at various jobs after high school: Lowes HIW, Tapioca Express, Swissport @ SFO, car repair shop, and a European auto parts warehouse, to name a few. Around 2015 my parents decided they'd had enough of the Bay Area (cost of living was getting ridiculous by this time) and moved to Golden, CO for better cost of living situation and to be near family. I did not go with them because I thought I could survive on my own out there. I was wrong. Fast forwad to 2016, I decided to move to Golden because I missed my family, and that's where my story ends. </p>
