      <p style="text-align: left"> I was born in Brawley, CA, a small farm town near the border of Mexicali, and lived in Imperial for about 9 years. Attended school at Ben Hulse Elementary for as long as I can remember before moving. Dad found a better paying job in Yuma, Arizona, and so we moved. </p>

      <p style="text-align: left"> We moved to Yuma when I was 9. Dad had found a better paying job working at an RV service shop. I attended Mary A. Otondo Elementary for about a year. It was here that I first road a motorcycle- an old Honda 3 wheeler. One very hot day (near the end of our stay in Yuma), I found my mother stairing out the window towards the street. I walked up and stood beside her, then looked the direction she was looking. There was a light breeze as we neared another monsoon season, and a tumbleweed blew past our house on the street before us. We stood there in silence for about 4-5 minutes, watching that tumbleweed, before my mother turned to me and said "Dang, we gotta get outta here..." LOL. Dad once again found a better job opportunity. This time back in Los Angeles. So we moved again. </p>

      <p style="text-align: left"> We moved to Irvine, CA (most likely the prettiest city I've ever lived in). Dad found the job that would end up becoming his specialty: A/V and home automation. The commute was killer... Irvine to Los Angeles, but dad made it work by lane splitting on his motorcycle. I went to Turtle Rock Elementary, where my homeroom teacher called me an "enigma" since I was "a good kid" but wasn't applying myself. I was sick of all the moving by this time, and tired of making new friends only to have to leave them to try and make other friends in a completely different city. </p>
